Doing IDE stuff in a text editor!  w00t!

For now, this is not dependent on anything from the brailsmt/clide project.  That will change, but I'm working this both ends.  While at my day job, I need to still remain productive, and as such I add a few things here and there to make my life easier while using the CLI and vim.  When I am not at work, I work on clide.  The hope is that I bridge the gap and creating a working IDE usable from the command line and from within vim.
